/**
 * @brief CUDA kernel to compute the curvature of 3D points in a point cloud.
 * This kernel computes the curvature for each point based on its position in 3D space.
 * For simplicity, the curvature is calculated as the Euclidean distance from the origin
 * of the point, but this can be expanded to more sophisticated curvature calculations
 * depending on the specific use case.
 * 
 * @param points The input array containing the 3D points, where each point is represented by three consecutive float values (x, y, z).
 * @param curvature The output array where the computed curvature values for each point will be stored.
 * @param num_points The total number of points in the input point cloud.
